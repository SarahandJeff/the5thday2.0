***** WORKS WITH 1.0 EXP *****


***** FPS No Quick Swap Icon *****


NOTE:  BEFORE INSTALLING -->ANY<--  MOD, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR SAVED GAMES!!!

Installs just like almost every mod. Does not require a new game.

After extracting the downloaded 7z file contents just place the entire folder
"FPS No Quick Swap Icon" into your mods folder and you should be ready to go.

The old Mods folder was located here:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die\Mods 

The newer Mods folder (recommended) is located here:
C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Roaming\7DaysToDie\Mods

You can also put   %AppData%\7DaysToDie\Mods  in the address bar in Windows Explorer
or in the Search Box on your desktop and it will take you to the correct location.

This mod makes the Quick Swap Icon on your toolbelt invisible. You also need to go into 
your game options and disable the key assigned to it to prevent toggling it by accident. 


I hope you enjoy the mod!
