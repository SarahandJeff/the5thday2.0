tutorialGBAP,Journal Tip,,,,"Dear Survivor, \n\nThankyou for intalling my [Ground Breakers Accessory Pack] Mod or GBAP for Short. GBAP Brings a few changes how some blocks (i.e Concrete Shapes) are destroyed they now downgrade to a previous tier [Concrete > Brick > Wood > Frames ect]. Using a tool with salvage Capabilities you can potentially earn the Full Upgrade Cost back & A low chance of the block itself. (Frames always pick up when destroyed)! Please enjoy. \n\nKindest Regards - R3dHot Gaming!",,
